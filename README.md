# Web-Dev-Library
It is a open source library where we believe in projects based learning(PBL).
We provide with you design and style-guide for every project. More projects are added in this library soon with help of contributors. \
In essence, the PBL model consists of these seven characteristics:
- Focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve.
- Brings what students should academically know, understand, and be able to do into the equation.
- Uses 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, among others.
- Builds student choice into the process.
- Provides opportunities for feedback and revision of the plan and the project.
- Requires students to present their problems, research process, methods, and results.
> So, join us and start doing these projects in this order:
